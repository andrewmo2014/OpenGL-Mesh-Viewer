Compiling Instructions
==========================================================================================
	When I completed the assignment, I primarily worked at an Athena Linux computer on campus.  However, I also managed to ssh into my athena account and was able to work on the assignment remotely as if I was at an athena cluster.  I downloaded all the required materials into a local directory.  I compiled after making necessary changes to main.cpp file.
	1.	Unzip submission on Stellar and extract all files to designated directory
	1.	In terminal, cd to directory with main.cpp
	2.	command make
	3.	command ./a0 < X.obj, where the input of X is either sphere, torus, garg

Problems
==========================================================================================
	Currently, my code is functioning properly.  I can toggle between 7 chosen colors, adjust the position of the light by decrementing/increment the x/y coordinates, and objects are loaded correctly.

Extra Credit
==========================================================================================
	I did not do the extra credit.  If a devoted myself more, I would have liked to introduce rotation to the objects or transition between different colors.

Comments
==========================================================================================
	I had fun with this project.  If I had more time, I would have attempted to have done the extra credit.  The mesh loader was challenging trying to parse strings correctly, but I was able to solve the problem after working diligently.  I wish it was made clear that we didn't have to follow the instructions strictly (as long as the job gets done, there are many ways to code to come to the same solution)
